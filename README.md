Project 3: Frogger

To launch the game, click on the "index.html" file.  

The goal of the game is to move the player from the green tiles (grass) to the blue tiles (water).

The arrow keys are used in order to move the player forward, backward, and side-to-side.

There will also be bugs moving across the screen at random speeds as well that the player will have to avoid.

If the player is touched by one of the bugs, the player will be moved back to the starting position.

If the player achieves the goal of making it to the water, that will also cause the player to be moved back to the starting poistion. But reaching the water, means you have technically won the game.
